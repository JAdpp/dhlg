This video examines the Charles "Teenie" Harris photography archive of the Carnegie Museum of Art. The museum staff turned to digital humanities methods to digitize and catalog the 80,000+ photographs in the collection, making them easily accessible for public browsing and use. The project used crowdsourcing to enhance and revise the materials by asking those who had been indentified in photos to provide their recollections, which were then used to improve the searching and cataloging algorithms.
