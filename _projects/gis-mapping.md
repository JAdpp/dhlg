# GIS Digital Mapping
*Susan Grunewald*

This video covers the basics for learning geographic information system (GIS) mapping. It includes information about different software options and data sources. Finally, it shows what results one can achieve in a historical GIS project through the author’s work mapping German prisoner of war camps in the Sovie Union during and after the Second World War.
