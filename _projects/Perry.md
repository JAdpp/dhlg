We are studying the cultural evolution of ideas and practical advice in online men's spaces known as the "manosphere." We seek to track the progression of manosphere ideology from the 1970s to the present by analyzing online forum data using computational techniques and close reading of primary and secondary sources referenced by these groups. We pull current data from news sharing sites such as Reddit, data from the 1990s and early 2000s from Usenet sites such as alt.seduction.fast, and other various blogs and forums.
