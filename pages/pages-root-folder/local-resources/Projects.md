## S

[**Six Degrees of Francis Bacon**](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com). Six Degrees of Francis Bacon is a digital reconstruction of the early modern social network that scholars and students from all over the world can collaboratively expand, revise, curate, and critique. Unlike published prose, Six Degrees is extensible, collaborative, and interoperable: extensible in that people and associations can always be added, modified, developed, or, removed; collaborative in that it synthesizes the work of many scholars; interoperable in that new work on the network is put into immediate relation to previously studied relationships. The project team includes Christopher Warren (CMU), Daniel Shore (Georgetown), Jessica Otis (GMU), Scott Weingart (CMU), and John Ladd (WashU), and many others.
