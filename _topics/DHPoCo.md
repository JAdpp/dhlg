teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

DH postcolonialism is the application of key facets of postcolonial studies such as critiques of colonialism, impreialism, and globalization and their relationships to race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability to digital humanities. Much like [DH Feminism]() aims to bring more women and approaches of feminist studies to DH, DH postcolonialism aims to decolonize digital studies.
