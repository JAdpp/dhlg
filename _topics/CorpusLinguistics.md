meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Corpus linguistics involves the study of language from a corpus of texts. In corpus linguistics, texts are grouped together by their type for study, that is texts of a similar nature are studied in relation to one another in order to produce meaningful results. For example, one can make a corpus of doctoral dissertations for study or a corpus of news articles from similar types of newspapers. Corpus linguistics can include the annotation of texts, or it can include the analysis of texts.
