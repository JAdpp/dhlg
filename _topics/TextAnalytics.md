Text analytics is the process of analyzing text after it has been already converted into a machine processable format, generally through the process of [text mining](/_topics/TextMining.md). Text analytics heavily relies upon natural language processing (NLP), a field of computer science that explores the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. Some examples of applied analytics processes are information retrieval from a corpus, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis.
