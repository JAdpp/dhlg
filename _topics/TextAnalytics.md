teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Text analytics is the process of analyzing text after it has been already converted into a machine processible format, generally through the process of [text mining](). Text analytics heavily relies upon natural language processing (NLP), a field of computer science that explores the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. Some examples of applied analytics processes are information retrieval from a corpus, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis.
