teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Web archiving is the act of creating an archive of information stored on the World Wide Web. Web archives frequently automatically access and download full copies of publically accessible websites through the process of web crawling. The idea is to perserve information stored on the web for research purposes. Scholars interested in web archiving may use it for the purposes of [Digital History]() or [Cultural Analytics]().
