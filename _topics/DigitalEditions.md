teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Digital editions are instances of texts such as novels or news publications that are hosted digitally rather than in a traditional print format. Digital eitions consist of websites or ebooks. When stylized as a website, digital editions allow scholars to easily include annotations and scholarly interpretations of a text through the use of [Textual Encoding]().
