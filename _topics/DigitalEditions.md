Digital editions are instances of texts such as novels or news publications that are hosted digitally rather than in a traditional print format. Digital eitions consist of websites or ebooks. When stylized as a website, digital editions allow scholars to easily include annotations and scholarly interpretations of a text through the use of [Textual Encoding](/_topics/TextualEncoding.md).
