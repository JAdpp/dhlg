teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Oral history is the practice of collecting oral testimonials about individuals on either audio or video through the process of interviews. Oral history seeks to collect and preserve information that is often not found in traditional written sources such as government documents, news publications, or memoirs. Not only can oral history contribute to traditional historical research, but it can also reach a wider audience than traditional scholarly publications due to its accessible and personal nature. Oral history can work well with [Digital History]().
