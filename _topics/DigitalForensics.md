teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Digital forensics is a form of forensic science that seeks to recover and investigate materials stored on digital devices. A practitioner of digital forensics can take meta data, for example, and use to to determine authorship of documents. Similar techniques can also be used to determine if a digital document has been tampered with or falsified in any way.
