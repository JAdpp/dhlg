Network analysis, or social network analysis, is the study of social relations and structures by way of networks and graph theory. Network analysis is one of the more popular DH methods used in [Digital history](/_topics/DigitalHistory.md) as well as literature and cultural studies. It can analyze and illustrate the number of connections between participants (density) as well as the frequency of interactions between participants in a network (centrality). Two of the most common tools for network analysis are [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and [Pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/).

For an example of how network analysis can be used to further historical reseasch see [Ku Klux: The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction](https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl60CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=parsons+klan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnhtX7vOLjAhVMheAKHS5rDPEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=parsons%20klan&f=false) (2015) Elaine Frantz Parsons. For examples of how network analysis bridges both intellectual history and literary and cultural studies see either the [Six Dgrees of Francis Bacon](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/?ids=10000473&min_confidence=60&type=network) or [Carolingian Networks](https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/projects/carolingian-networks) projects.
