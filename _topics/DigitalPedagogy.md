teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Digital pedagogy is the use of digital technologies for both teaching and learning. Digital pedagogy can encompass websites that include full lessons, like [SocialChange101.org](http://socialchange101.org/); online repositories of annotated primary sources, like [Seventeen Moments in Soviet History](http://soviethistory.msu.edu/); and using technology for assignments to assess student learning such as having students create a blog post or podcast instead of a traditional paper or exam.
