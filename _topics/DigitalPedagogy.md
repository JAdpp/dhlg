Digital pedagogy is the use of digital technologies for both teaching and learning. Digital pedagogy can encompass websites that include full lessons, like [SocialChange101.org](http://socialchange101.org/); online repositories of annotated primary sources, like [Seventeen Moments in Soviet History](http://soviethistory.msu.edu/); and using technology for assignments to assess student learning such as having students create a blog post or podcast instead of a traditional paper or exam.
