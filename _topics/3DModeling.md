teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional model either through computer software or through 3D printing. 3D moderling serves as the basis for many [Virtual Reality]() experiences. 3D models can be "drawn" by hand in a computer or created through the use of videos or photographs. Creating 3D models from photographs, espeically in the case of archaeology, is known as photogrammetry.
