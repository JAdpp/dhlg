teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Open Data is data that is free for anyone to access, modify, and share. The concept of open data comes from the movement to release a variety of other open things such as open source or open access. Open data has a variety of sponsors, but one of the most frequent forms of open data is civic data. Once downloaded, scholars can run this information through a variety of other websites or programs to produce historical, policy, evironmental, etc. findings. Open Data works well for [Digital History]().
