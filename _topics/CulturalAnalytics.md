teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Cultural analytics is the study of large-scale visual data sets. The field was largely developed by Lev Manovich. It is largely a branch of visual analytics. Practitioners generally mine large sets of cultural data such as library catalogs, collections of images, or social networks. Software tools scan a corpus of either still or moving images to extract data for further study and analysis.
