teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Distant reading, as the name suggests, is the opposite of the traditional form of literary analysis known as close reading. Instead of the interpretation of a small textual selection, distant reading is the act of creating a large textual corpus and then having a computer perform analysis. In essence, this means reading texts without actually reading the texts. The objective of distant reading is not to scruitinize a particular work, but to see texts in relation to one another as part of a system.
