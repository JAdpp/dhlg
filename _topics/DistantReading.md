Distant reading, as the name suggests, is the opposite of the traditional form of literary analysis known as close reading. Instead of the interpretation of a small textual selection, distant reading is the act of creating a large textual corpus and then having a computer perform analysis. In essence, this means reading texts without actually reading the texts. The objective of distant reading is not to scrutinize a particular work, but to see texts in relation to one another as part of a system.
