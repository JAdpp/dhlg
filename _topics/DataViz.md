teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Data visualization, or DataViz, concerns the visual representation of data in a varitey of ways including graphs, plots, [maps](HGIS), and other graphics like and illustration of a [network](network analysis). There are a variety of best practices to follow when visualizing data that can help readers better grasp what the author is trying to covey by means of the graphic.

Examples of data visualization software include [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) for GIS mapping or [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and [Pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/) for network analysis. Data visualization can be accomplished with more traditional word processing applications as well such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. There are also programs and services that can produce a variety of different visualizations in a polished fashion such as [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) or [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). 

NB that many of the approaches and tools for data viz come from the natural and social sciences. For some discussion of how best to apply visualization techniques to humanistic research see [humanities visualization]().
