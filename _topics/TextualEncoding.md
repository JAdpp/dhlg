teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

The Text Encoding Intiative (TEI) is a a large communtiy of practice that defines a specific branch of eXtensible Markup Language (XML). A markup language is a text processing system that annotates documents in ways that they are both human and machine readable. Both XML and TEI support numorous languages through Unicode. The goal of TEI is to maintain a standard for representing texts in digital form in order to further their study by scholars from a variet of fields such as literary studies, history, and linguistics. TEI is extremely useful for annotating texts and presenting these annotated texts in digital editions.
