Machine learning is the use of algorithms and statistical models to have a computer perform an automated task through patterns and inference rather than explicit instructions. Machine learning operates on building a training model. After the required information is learned from the training model, it can then be applied to other datasets or tasks. [Stylometry](/_topics/Stylometry.md) is an example of digital humanities machine learning.
