teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

DH feminism aims to emphasize and increase the role of women and feminists in technology and digital humanities. It started as a reaction to the criticism of how DH often had structures in place that kept women from engaging in the community. It also pushes back against DH furthing patriachal discourses in the Academy. For similar approaches, but with an emphasis on postcolonialism, see [DHPoCo]().
