Text mining is the process of deriving information by way of statistical pattern learning from text. Text is formatted in a structured fashion and then a computer program derives patterns from the text, which can then in turn be evaluated and interpreted in the process of [Text analytics](/_topics/TextAnalytics.md). Text mining can be carried out with a variety of commercial and open source programs and companies.
