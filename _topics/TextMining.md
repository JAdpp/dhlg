teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Text mining is the process of deriving information by way of statistical pattern learning from text. Text is formatted in a structured fashion and then a computer program dervies patterns from the text, which can then in turn be evaluated and interpreted in the process of [Text analytics](). Text mining can be carried out with a variety of commerical and open source programs and companies.
