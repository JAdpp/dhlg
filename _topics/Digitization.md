teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Digitization is the process of taking a physical source and making a digital version of it either for preservation or analysis. Digitization can take many different approaches and forms. 

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of scanning the text of a print book and converting the image file back into editable text. The paid version of Adobe Acrobat has a built in OCR feature. The paid program [AbbyyFinereader](https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/what-is-ocr/) is a very good program for OCR. If your text is in tabular format, the free software [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) is the best tool for the approach.

Digitizing images such as photographs or drawings and saving them as image files (like .jpeg or .tiff) allows them to be examined for the purposes of [cultural analytics]() or [digital art history](). Digital images can also be housed online for [digital public history]() projects such as museum websites or online archives.

Another form of digitization is [3D modeling](). 3D models can be used for a variety of historical, artistic, or archaeological research. 3D modeling also allows for the creation of [virtual reality]() experiences, which can be applied to a variety of disciplines such as history or English for the purposes of [digital pedagogy]().
