teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that is interested in the rule-based modeling of any natural (human) language from a computational perspective. It is also interested in computational approaches to the study of traditional questions of linguistics research. Originally, computational linguistics was practiced by computer scientists, but today scholars of a vairety of backgrounds are interested in the field including linguists, philosophers, and psychologists.
